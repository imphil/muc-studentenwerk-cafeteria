=== CAFETERIA DATA ENGINE ===

== BUILD REQUIREMENTS ==
Packages for SUSE:
* libplasma1
* kdebase4-workspace-devel

== BUILDING ==
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DPLUGIN_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/lib64/kde4/ -DSERVICES_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/share/kde4/services/ ..
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo kbuildsycoca4

== TEST IT ==
run
$ plasmaengineexplorer

then select "cafeteria" from the dropdown list of available engines. The source
"location" should be populated with some data shortly (if you have a network
connection). To get a menu for a location, type menu:421 into the source input
field and wait for the result to come up (you should get today's menu of the 
Mensa Arcisstrasse, Munich).

== USE IT ==
Log out and in again. Then the plasmoid should be able to use the data engine.
